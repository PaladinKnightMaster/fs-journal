## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows the use of passing the properties of a class to another class. This allows the instances of the base class to be used in the derived class

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

No, a class gets many members but not the members that are static, private, or a constructor

theres different levels of accessibility and those different levels can be used with inheritance to change what is able to be used in base or derived classes.
