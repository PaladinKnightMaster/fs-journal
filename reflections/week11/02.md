## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is the unique identifier for a row on  a table, and foreign keys are used to reference the primary key on a separate table

2. What is an `Alias`?

aliases are used in order to give tables with names a different keyword. This is useful in making long tables names shorter.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors_patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
```
When given a specific doctor's Id, 
You could use...
```
SELECT p.*, d.* FROM doctors_patients dc
JOIN patients p ON p.id = dc.patientId
JOIN doctors d ON d.id = @GivenId
WHERE dc.doctorId = @GivenId;
```

This sql statement is referencing the doctors_patients table. The doctors_patients table is filtered to where only the patients that are related to the doctorId will be selected. After only the patients that are related to the doctor are selected, the information of the patients and the information of the doctor is added to the sql response.

I think the steps that the algorithm actually take to complete are different but thats the way that I make sense about these kinds of query statements.
