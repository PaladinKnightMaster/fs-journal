## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

As Ive gone through this course Ive only become increasingly more aware that there is an extreme amount of things I don't know. After I finish finding where to continue appears a little nerve wracking. Ive definitely noticed over my time in academic environments I learn easier when Im in a place that specifically encourages academic learning. This course was very helpful in that I often had multiple instructors available to explain concepts I had difficulty understanding.
As for my final I want to be able to set goals for each day. Something that helped me feel more motivated in my group project was how we would be able to define what we want to do each day and Im glad I found something like that to implement into my final. I feel confident, nervous and excited to give a in depth project like this a try.
