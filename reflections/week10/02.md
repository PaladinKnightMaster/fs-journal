## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

it represents a group of variables, it seems to be an array as you can find things by their index. 
What contridicts my thought on this is there is a function .ToArray that converts the list into an array. This is definitly something ill have to look into more

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

The functionality of finding based on something's index, adding something or replacing the value of an item all seem like some basic important funtionality. I presonally think the Sort functionality would be super useful if you needed it but I havent come into a situation where Ive needed to sort from least to greatest yet. 

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

You could retrieve an item based on its index; this would look something like - Item ChosenItem = list[0]
This could be paired with the .BinarySearch() function to find the index of the item you want. The name "Binary Search" makes me think that this function only applies to integer based values

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Csharp is starting to seem repetetive. This is also something many of my classmates have recognized as well, so I am glad that I am not alone in this recognition. I think its only seeming repetetive because I am not as far in as I was with node. Im still fairly excited to be learning a more professional language!
