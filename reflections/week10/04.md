## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An Enum is a property that holds a specific value based on its name

2. How can you modify an Enum?

you can change the default type of the enum by changing its base type. This is done similarly to if your were extracting a class onto another class. You can also change the value of the enum by setting it to a new value. In the case of bytes it appeared as though the change of one value would affect the values of the subsequent enums

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

We had used an enum in a project that was based off of the Harry Potter media. By making the houses property an enum we could declare a character as being a part of a specific house
