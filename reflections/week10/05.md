# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I think my adaptation to c# was pretty smooth. Obviously I am limited to my experience and knowledge for now unlike javascript but I think my understanding of js has made this much easier.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
I was pretty surprised to find out how lenient javascript is. Im finally understanding what my instructors have mentioned when they say Js is the 'wild wild west'
- What are you struggling with?
So far VsCode has begun to have difficulty with Csharp and has thrown errors when its unneeded. I have trouble recognizing when the error is coming form a mistake of my own or one from VsCode and restarting my project halts my productivity. Im sure once I get more experience with Csharp 
- What would you count as a victory?
I want to continue to learn more about how I can use c# as well as the purposes of things. I think one of my biggest interests in software development is understanding the 'why' of different methodologies and design
