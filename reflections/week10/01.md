## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value - Is a data type that directly holds a value(Generally integer related data), 

Reference - Is a data type that stores the location of the data to 'reference' the data when it needs to (generally more complex data),

Pointer - is a data type that references an object(an object that holds values within)

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

value type data types appear to be integer based, theres some types im unfamiliar with but they seem to refernece easily stored data

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types hold the location of where its specified data is stored so that instead of delivering the specified data itself, it can 'reference' to the location of where the data is, this value type seems to be used with more complex data
