## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Information in a row is the full data of one item; meaning you get the values from each category in the table.
Information of  a columm is the data from all items but only for the specified category(chosen via column).

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters
(

id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

 name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

 age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
 
 //age INT NOT NULL CHECK(age >= 0) to be able to check

 description VARCHAR(255)
)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

DELETE FROM table_name will remove all data stored in the table

DROP TABLE table_name will delete the table entirely
