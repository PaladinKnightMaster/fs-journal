> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

Callback hell is the writing of javascript by expecting the code on the current line to fully run before the code on the following line. This can look like a pyramid

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

async refers to the function as a function that will take a portion of time to complete. I know that using a remote database uses asynchronous in order to gain access to the 'await' keyword. Callbacks are functions that will run when the time needed is over and will input the data into the original function where it needs to go

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Keep code shallow - separate code into separate functions when available and just call the necessary function. 

Modularize - make small functions that do one small job and compile those small functions into a larger overall function to do advanced things with

Handle every error - errors can come at any point when you are calling data from a remote source so make sure to format code to display what the error is
