## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending, Resolved, or Rejected. These symbolize if the promise is waiting to be completed, successful, or unsuccessful

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Promises give the opportunity to chain callbacks for better more organized code. This better organization prevents 'callback hell'

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

the .then() method is used only for successful promises, allowing the code to continue its process - .catch() is used for unsuccessful promises and begins the process in the instance of a failed promise
