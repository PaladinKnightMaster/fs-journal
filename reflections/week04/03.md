## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

Async and await are used to stop the code until data can be passed through from a server. This week we use it to fulfill a promise from api servers.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

You must make the function async. After some research i found that the function needs to be labeled async because it registers that the function may contain a promise when initialized.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

Async and await allow your code to be made simpler than using fetch, it also allows multiple functions to be able to run in a series much more efficiently.
