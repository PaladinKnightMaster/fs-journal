# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
something about what each function does to an api clicked with me later in the week. It made it way easier to understand what we were working on
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
that you have you use the specific id of what api object youre using in the url
- What are you struggling with?
I had a difficult time figuring out the time aspect on the checkpoint as well as figuring out why my put request wasnt working.
Im also starting to have a harder time with time management, I have so many things to do and when I limit how much time I get to do that and my assignment, it makes it difficult to get a good amount of sleep
- What would you count as a victory?
a  rubber ducky!
