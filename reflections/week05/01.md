## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

A Query String allows you to specify parts of a url to filter what you want. The query string has to be set up on the server side tho

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

?key=value, It starts with the ? to signal the query param in the url, you can distinguish because each unique param is separated by a '&'

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

I think when you need to filter by something or when you are searching for a group of things that could be distinguished by one of their properties

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I followed along really well today during lecture. I understood the concepts really well, the specicifics and syntax arent memorized yet but Im feeling good. That could be becasue theres a few things that got cut out of todays lecture like how to set up an actual database instead of making a hardcoded array.
