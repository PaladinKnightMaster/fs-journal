## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One to One, One to many, and many to many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

The benefits of linking instead of embedding are that linking is a more simplified way to set relationships of data. It is also important because it keeps data simple -> this leads to less amounts of data being drawn when calling on an object. This seems to indicate some sort of standard in large objects

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

I think knowing when an object might qualify as a many to many but the specific scenario doesn't reflect that. What i mean is that I think sometimes an object or objects will require a many to many relationship but it can be difficult to recognize that when what you're starting out with qualifies as separate relationships.
