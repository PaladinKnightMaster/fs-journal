## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

- using vh and vw. I think making the height and width to be based on the viewport instead of a base measurement is fs my favorite design tip

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

- Google > Pintrest or other listing sites.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

- I personally think design is indicative of competancy. When somethings design is poor I generally expect it to be something that isnt fully finished or something that might not be good work. With only design, a sense of a well made product could be conveyed
