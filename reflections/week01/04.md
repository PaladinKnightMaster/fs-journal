## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

To make a visual of how you should format your code structure in terms of what is presented to the user.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

the different levels of detail are the (blue) containers, (red) rows, and (green) columns. They work as a way to make formatting a page easier.
Containers are useful in formatting/styling the largest sections of details.
Rows are useful for formatting and styling its child columns.
Columns are the main pieces being presented. Having everything set up this way gives you multiple layers of styling/formatting

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think if you're trying to look at something complicated it can certainly be good as a quick sketch. It would also be really useful for employers to be able to give a good visual of what the design should be
