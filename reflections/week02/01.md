## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

The extent to which a variable is able to be read. 

2. What is Hoisting ?

A JavaScript mechanism that repositions the declaration of code (Functions, Variables, etc.) to the top of the declarations scope before executing the code. This allows the machine reading code to have everything declared before a value is imputed or executed.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

let is useful to keep local variables scoped within an area of code, var is useful to have a single variable able to be called in multiple areas of code regardless of parental status (but the same principle could be served by having a global let variable), and const is useful to declare a variable without allowing the value to be manipulated
