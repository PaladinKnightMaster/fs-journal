## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

A plan keeps you organized and on track. It stops you from trying to do a bunch of things at once which is something I sometimes struggle with

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

When Im stuck I will begin by reviewing what ive done, and what I can still try. I then will research any new options that I havent tried yet or I might run it by a colleague to see what they think about it

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Make proper plans, use good solution strategies, put effort into your code, and keep a level of skeptical-ness about the code you make and see.
