## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

A handler will have the object operation and/or some custom logic to apply to an object - the common operations are get and set

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

you need to return the value of the property being accessed by finding the defined property on the defined object

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

proxies can apply custom logic to object operations, an example of this would be to limit access to certain properties on a 'get' operation
