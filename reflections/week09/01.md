## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using the skrum methedology and organization tools like trello to stay organized and efficiet

2. What went well so far?

So far we have had almost no conflicts or issues with making changes to the project, staying on task, and working at a good pace

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I think if we could do anything differently I would say we should have split up the tasks more. We started this today but were starting to get comfertable in staying on the same section that weve been working on and this has made it a little difficult to switch to another section that we are unfamiliar with. Hopefully this wont become an issue
