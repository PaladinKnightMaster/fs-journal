## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 is a way to represent the binary data of an image by displaying it as text

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

Base64 has a few issues. It often increases the file size for an image, adds extra work to the cpu in order to be able to process the image, and doesnt permit the browser to cache the image locally --> leads to extra calls for the image from your server

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Before browsers were able to use a higher amount connections to a server the base64 helped relieve stress on those connections by linking directly from a HTTP link which allowed for independent drawing of each of those images
