# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I think working as a team was pretty fun, It is more relieving and less stressful to do an entire project with a group of people rather than actually as an individual
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
I was able to implement some new things into the project. Im starting to be able to depend on myself more to figure things out
- What are you struggling with?
Theres not too much Im struggling with. We were able to make our project more fleshed out today and its not something that is stressing me out. Im excited to learn 'C#' next week
- What would you count as a victory?
If my team and I are able to show off this project with pride
