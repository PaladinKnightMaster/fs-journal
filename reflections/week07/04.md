![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

I used the JSDocs to help store my questions as well as the answer to them

2. What went well this week?

I feel like the backend wasnt as hard as I expected

3. What would you do differently?

I would have done a lot more work on the backend first, most of my questions are on the front end and now Im feeling pressured to figure them out on my own because of graduations
