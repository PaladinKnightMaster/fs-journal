# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I feel more confident in my ability to do code, I feel like things have an answer and theres ways to solve my problems
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
I think the work load is a little high. Im pushing myself to get a perfect score on this project and its a little stressful
- What would you count as a victory?
If my understanding of vue, as well as back end and front end concepts are more fleshed out. I want to be more knowledgable in what i need to do and be able to internally plan the steps in my goal - if i can do those things I would count this as a victory. I also would really like to excel in this project
