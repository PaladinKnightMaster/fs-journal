# Final Reflection
The Final Week, The Final day of Course Work. How did it go? Are you ready for career week?

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I was able to finish my work. I was able to be mostly independent and any questions i had i was able to ask generally without specifically applying to the project
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
I learned how efficient my work is when I work at home. I dint realize my setup was so convenient 
- What are you struggling with?
Im struggling with learning important concepts online. I think I learn easier when I have someone in person or through a video teaching a concept.
- What would you count as a victory?
I want the golden duck. I think it would represent a good achievement in regards to my ability and I would like to be able to see that materialized in a rubber duck. (That sounds a little silly to type out ðŸ˜„)
