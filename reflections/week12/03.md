# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
Todays going alright. Im not in the place I want to be in comparison to my classmates but I still feel confident that ill be able to finish before the deadline
- Are you managing your stress?
Stress is starting to increase. Ive mostly been able to be efficient with my time in moving to a different piece of the project when I am stuck at a problem for too long. This has been able to continue my progress steadily instead of being trapped in something im not understanding.
- What has you most worried?
I feel like I took too much time in spending effort on how things look before they were fully functional. Im still glad that my project isn't looking like low effort piece but I wish I had taken less time on aesthetics until I was finished.
