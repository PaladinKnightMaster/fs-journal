# Daily Reflection
One day left are you going to make it? We believe in you!ðŸ’–! Are you timeboxing appropriately? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
Today is going same as usual. Im starting to wrap up all of my functionality. I really wasnt as behind as I initially thought. I wish I was able to find the information on some of the new topics that im looking for. Its a little frustrating to find poorly documented information.
- Are you managing your stress?
Im definitely trying. My efforts on managing stress are starting to diminish but its not something that will be an issue because Ill be done by tomorrow or maybe even later tonight
- What has you most worried?
As the end of the course starts to approach Im a little worried that Ill be underqualified in getting a job. I think its natural because I have no knowledge of actual workplace settings outside of this education environment. I think im also a little worried that the job market will be less gracious to jr software developers.
