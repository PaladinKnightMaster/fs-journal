# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
Today went well, I was permitted to stay home and work on my project here. I found that my environment I have set up is much more comfortable than I had noticed before, I wish I had started taking advantage of this sooner!
- Are you managing your stress?
Mostly. Ive been able to stay pretty focused so far. I haven't ran into any major hiccups
- What has you most worried?
Theres a few new concepts on this project that havent been fully explored before. This is going to give me the opportunity to learn and research but I worry that understanding them in depth will be time consuming
