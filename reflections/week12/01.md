# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
Today is going well, I wish I brought my earbuds because the noise from others is a little distracting
- Are you managing your stress?
Im doing alright with stress, Back end was mostly situated last night. I have only a little left to implement and I really like how c# runs so Im not worried with that
- What has you most worried?
I worry that because its been a little while since ive really gone in depth with vue that my usual pace will be a little slower
