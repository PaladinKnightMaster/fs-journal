## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing - testing units of code independently of each other, this allows consise understanding of what works and doesnt
Component Testing - using testing tools that are compatible with Vue's framework. This is curious to me because it seems complicated and harder to understand
End to End Testing - Testing that vaildates all layers of your code from the front end to the back end

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think unit testing is the most useful because it seems the most general and applicable to all situations

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I think component testing is probably the most hard ot understand. If you need an external application that that might require you to become proficient on how that works and then develop your own opinions on what you like to use more.
