# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I think team work is certainly helpful in these projects and I really like the aspect of working in teams
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
I was surprised to realize how efficient a team can be. Within a single work day we had done the work it would have taken me all day and all night to get done. 
- What are you struggling with?
Partner programming is something I would like to get more practice with. When Im the one coding I tend to just go do what I need to do and I find that i struggle to utilize my partner as a external source as well as I would like to. 
- What would you count as a victory?
If the team and I are able to continue having a fun time doing this project, and completing it would be fantastic as well.
