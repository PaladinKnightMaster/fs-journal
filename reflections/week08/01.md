## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

it allows the employer the availability to see the projects youve worked on, this gives them the oppertunity to understand what your capable of

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

when you have some good content to show off. Content that can display your adaquacy and your work ethic as well as your experience

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I would like to include tower in my portfolio because to me I think having a really functional website with a fully personally made server is a good peice. Theres still some things I would like to restyle like the tickets but that isnt a problem. I also think the capstone is a good piece to add. Im working on some great functionality and like tower it will include the personally made server. I think these two projects are also good in terms of displaying vue competency. I would also plan on including my final in this protfolio but I havent made that quite yet
